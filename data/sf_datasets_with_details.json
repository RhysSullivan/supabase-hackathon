Visitors to Transbase will be redirected to this page where they can view, visualize, and download Traffic Crash data.A. SUMMARYThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD’s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.The crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. For example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). To learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the TIMS documentationB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. C. UPDATE PROCESSAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analysis, interpretation, or communication.This dataset can also be queried on the TransBASE Dashboard. TransBASE is a geospatially enabled database maintained by SFDPH that currently includes over 200 spatially referenced variables from multiple agencies and across a range of geographic scales, including infrastructure, transportation, zoning, sociodemographic, and collision data, all linked to an intersection or street segment. TransBASE facilitates a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing transportation-related health issues,informed by a large and growing evidence base regarding the importance of transportation system design and land use decisions for health. TransBASE’s purpose is to inform public and private efforts to improve transportation system safety, sustainability, community health and equity in San Francisco.E.

    "description": "***Note: As of 12/22/23, Law Enforcement Calls for Service data related to calls that originated from the 311 Connected Worker app and were dispatched from the Healthy Streets Operations Center (HSOC) have been recoded to better capture the nature of these calls. These calls were previously categorized as \"on view\" calls and were hard to distinguish from other types of \"on view\" calls for service where a San Francisco Police Department unit were dispatched based on viewing an incident in the field. They will now be identified using a new value in the onview_flag data field of \"HSOC.\" This affects historic data as well as new data in the Law Enforcement Calls for Service datasets. ***A. SUMMARYLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service – Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (‘On-View’).   The Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff’s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. Please refer Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer for full documentation B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED  Once a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   C.

This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.Tests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. A redundant run is scheduled at 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.E. CHANGE LOG4/10/2024 - An issue with our testing data was identified and corrected leading to a small increase in testing records over time. 6/21/2023 - A small number of additional COVID-19 testing records were released as part of our ongoing data cleaning efforts. 1/31/2023 - renamed column “last_updated_at” to “data_as_of”. 1/31/2023 - added columns “cumulative_tests”, “cumulative_positive_tests”, “cumulative_negative_tests”, “cumulative_indeterminate_tests”. 4/16/2021 - dataset updated to refresh with a five-day data lag.",

In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Prior to 1985, developers provided POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. The 1985 Downtown Plan created the first systemic requirements for developers to provide publicly accessible open space as a part of projects in C-3 Districts. The goal was to “provide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.” (See Planning Code Section 138 for regulations). Since then, project sponsors for residential projects may provide POPOS instead of their required open spaces in the Downtown Residential (DTR) and Eastern Neighborhoods (Section 135 of the Planning Code).

    "description": "A. SUMMARYMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.On September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.Cases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.Dataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. Geographic areas summarized are:1. Analysis Neighborhoods2. Census Tracts3. Census Zip Code Tabulation AreasB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to ([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.C. UPDATE PROCESSGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).Privacy rules in effectTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20Rates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website.Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deathsA single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality. While some cases cannot be mapped to sub-areas like Census Tracts, ongoing data quality efforts result in improved mapping on a rolling basis.E. CHANGE LOG9/11/2023 - data on COVID-19 cases and deaths summarized by geography are no longer being updated.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis dataset contains COVID-19 positive confirmed cases aggregated by several different geographic areas and by day. COVID-19 cases are mapped to the residence of the individual and shown on the date the positive test was collected. In addition, 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates are included to calculate the cumulative rate per 10,000 residents.Dataset covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Data updated daily.Geographic areas summarized are:1. Analysis Neighborhoods2. Census Tracts3. Census Zip Code Tabulation AreasB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDAddresses from the COVID-19 case data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area for a given date.The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a cumulative rate which is equal to ([cumulative count up to that date] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of total cases per 10,000 residents (as of the specified date).COVID-19 case data undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes and are continually updated to maximize completeness and accuracy of information. This means data may change for previous days as information is updated.C. UPDATE PROCESSGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 05:00 Pacific Time.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).This dataset can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 throughout the city, in a variety of geographic areas. Note that the new cases column in the data represents the number of new cases confirmed in a certain area on the specified day, while the cumulative cases column is the cumulative total of cases in a certain area as of the specified date.Privacy rules in effectTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:1. Any area with a cumulative case count less than 10 are dropped for all days the cumulative count was less than 10. These will be null values.2. Once an area has a cumulative case count of 10 or greater, that area will have a new row of case data every day following.3. Cases are dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 10004. Deaths data are not included in this dataset for privacy reasons. The low COVID-19 death rate in San Francisco, along with other publicly available information on deaths, means that deaths data by geography and day is too granular and potentially risky. Read more in our privacy guidelinesRate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20Rates are not calculated unless the cumulative case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website.Rows included for Citywide case countsRows are included for the Citywide case counts and incidence rate every day. These Citywide rows can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality. While some cases cannot be mapped to sub-areas like Census Tracts, ongoing data quality efforts result in improved mapping on a rolling bases.Related datasetSee the dataset of the most recent cumulative counts for all geographic areas here: https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-Summarized-by-Geography/tpyr-dvncE.

The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updatesC. UPDATE PROCESSThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as neededD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETInterpreting dates in this datasetThis dataset has 2 dates:1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself2. First Published - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated dateNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list.

This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. Data includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the “Status” column. The “Status” column also includes all available beds.This daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the “Bed Type” column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.Note: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities. As described above, those long term care facilities are not included here as they don’t have the capacity to take in additional acute care patients and therefore aren’t included in capacity measures.",

Alleys narrower than 25 feet can have de facto speed limits of 15 MPH. B. METHODOLOGY  Speed limit legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation and in some cases directives from engineers in the 5212 classification. Speed limit implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for speed limits will specify when signs are put in stating the new speed limits, and the work order that the sign installation was spec'd in.  C.

This data supports San Francisco's climate change planning and mitigation strategies.Note: Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated based on the ICLEI 2012 U.S. Community Protocol Version 1.0. San Francisco inventories are completed in accordance with the ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol (USCP) for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The methodology and sectors tracked were third party verified in inventory year 2012. The subsequent inventories are completed according to the guidance of the verifiers. The third-party verification memo for 2010 is available at http://sfenvironment.org/download/2010-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-march-2013 and for 2012 at http://sfenvironment.org/download/2012-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-january-2015. In 2015, the City began reporting its emissions to C40 to improve its GHG emissions inventory by using a newer protocol to estimate emissions referred to as the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC). GPC is a framework unifying emissions inventories globally while incorporating new categories to track. San Francisco has been tracking its emissions since 1990; hence, it continues to use the ICLEI USCP. Today, San Francisco continues to disclose emissions under the GPC framework for reporting purposes to and compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors (GCOM).",

Data updates as more information becomes available. Because of this, death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Death data is provided by the California Department of Public Health.It takes time to process this data. Because of this, death totals may increase or decrease over time.Data are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.C.

This change was applied to COVID-19 deaths retrospectively beginning on 1/1/2023. More information about the recommendation by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists that motivated this change can be found here. 4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. 1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented.",

Call locations reported before April 24, 2024 are currently mapped to a slightly different set of intersections than those reported on or after April 24. This may result in slight reporting irregularities for analyses that span this date. We will harmonize all historical data and resolve this as soon as possible.A. SUMMARY  Dispatched Calls-For-Service – Closed Calls includes all calls for service which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (‘On-View’). The Closed Calls dataset includes only calls for service that have been closed, and is updated every 24 hours, to include the initial call type, final call type and call disposition. Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. All relevant time intervals are also included. Dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff’s Office, and others. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. Please refer to the  Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer  for full documentationB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED  Once a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily at 2:00am with previous days data.  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET Please refer  Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer   for full documentation. Note: As of 12/22/23, Law Enforcement Calls for Service data related to calls that originated from the 311 Connected Worker app and were dispatched from the Healthy Streets Operations Center (HSOC) have been recoded to better capture the nature of these calls. These calls were previously categorized as \"on view\" calls and were hard to distinguish from other types of \"on view\" calls for service where a San Francisco Police Department unit were dispatched based on viewing an incident in the field. They will now be identified using a new value in the onview_flag data field of \"HSOC.\" This affects historic data as well as new data in the Law Enforcement Calls for Service datasets.E.

The date on which each population characteristic type was archived can be found in the field “data_loaded_at”.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 cases are from:  * Case interviews  * Laboratories  * Medical providers    These multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes.   Race/ethnicity* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.* The population estimates for the \"Other\" or “Multi-racial” groups should be considered with caution. The Census definition is likely not exactly aligned with how the City collects this data. For that reason, we do not recommend calculating population rates for these groups. Gender* The City collects information on gender identity using these guidelines. Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) occupancy* A Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) is a type of long-term care facility that provides care to individuals, generally in their 60s and older, who need functional assistance in their daily lives.  * This dataset includes data for COVID-19 cases reported in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) through 12/31/2022, archived on 1/5/2023. These data were identified where “Characteristic_Type” = ‘Skilled Nursing Facility Occupancy’.  Sexual orientation* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable. * The City doesn’t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age. * Case investigation interviews transitioned to the California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant information gathering beginning December 2021. The Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old. Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation.  Comorbidities* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death.  HomelessnessPersons are identified as homeless based on several data sources: * self-reported living situation * the location at the time of testing * Department of Public Health homelessness and health databases * Residents in Single-Room Occupancy hotels are not included in these figures. These methods serve as an estimate of persons experiencing homelessness. They may not meet other homelessness definitions.  Single Room Occupancy (SRO) tenancy* SRO buildings are defined by the San Francisco Housing Code as having six or more \"residential guest rooms\" which may be attached to shared bathrooms, kitchens, and living spaces. * The details of a person's living arrangements are verified during case interviews.  Transmission Type* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset has been archived and will no longer update as of 9/11/2023.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). This dataset includes many different types of characteristics. Filter the “Characteristic Type” column to explore a topic area. Then, the “Characteristic Group” column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of cases on each date. New cases are the count of cases within that characteristic group where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. Cumulative cases are the running total of all San Francisco cases in that characteristic group up to the specimen collection date listed.This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases. Data updates as more information becomes available. To explore data on the total number of cases, use the ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Cases Over Time dataset.E.

Information about each filing received for the parcel is included, such as Filer Type (Owner / Tenant), Filer Name, and Situs Address from the  Filing.  The dataset also includes whether a parcel is vacant , and if so, the tax rate applied. Parcels marked as vacant either reported as vacant in the tax filing or were determined to be vacant by the Tax Collector. All information displayed is subject to audit by the Tax Collector. Filings that are reflected as Pending are under review by the Tax Collector. Reasons for review include: the filer reported that the parcel is not Taxable Commercial Space (i.e the parcel does not have a structure, is not within the boundaries, does not otherwise meet the definition of Taxable Commercial Space), or the Parcel Number and Situs Addresses are not aligned.  If you are a taxpayer and need to update the information displayed, you should re-file https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/commercial-vacancy-tax-cvt or contact the Tax Collector for assistance.  If you wish to share information about a vacant property subject to the Commercial Vacancy Tax with the Tax Collector to assist with enforcement, visit https://sftreasurer.org/report-vacant-commercial-property B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThis dataset delineates parcels with “Taxable Commercial Space” - meaning parcels where one or more property owner(s) and/or commercial tenant(s) are required to file or pay the Commercial Vacancy Tax. The dataset includes the Block, Lot, Parcel Number and Situs Address for each commercial parcel within the named Districts. Information about each filing received for the parcel is included, such as Filer Type (Owner / Tenant), Filer Name, Situs Address from Filing, whether the filer reported a vacancy, and if so, the tax rate applied. The information displayed is reported by the taxpayers and subject to audit by the Tax Collector.C. UPDATE PROCESSData will be refreshed daily until further notice.  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETFilings that are reflected as Pending are under review by the Tax Collector. Reasons for review include: the filer reported that the parcel is not Taxable Commercial Space (ie the parcel does not have a structure, is not within the boundaries, does not otherwise meet the definition of Taxable Commercial Space), or the Parcel Number and Situs Addresses are not aligned.

Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.If a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.C.

The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.During the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.D.

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset reports the number of new residential units made available for occupancy in San Francisco since January 2018. Each row in this dataset shows the change in the number of new units associated with a building permit application. Each row also includes the date those units were approved for occupancy, the type of document approving them, and their address.Values in the column [Number of Units Certified] can be added together to produce a count of new units approved for occupancy since January 2018. These records provide a preliminary count of new residential units. The San Francisco Planning Department issues a Housing Inventory Report each year that provides a more complete account of new residential units, and those results may vary slightly from records in this dataset. The Housing Inventory Report is an in-depth annual research project requiring extensive work to validate information about projects. By comparison, this dataset is meant to provide more timely updates about housing production based on available administrative data. The Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department will reconcile these records with future Housing Inventory Reports.B. METHODOLOGY At the end of each month, DBI staff manually calculate how many new units are available for occupancy for each building permit application and enters that information into this dataset. These records reflect counts for all types of residential units, including authorized accessory dwelling units. These records do not reflect units demolished or removed from the city’s available housing stock.Multiple records may be associated with the same building permit application number, which means that new certifications or amendments were issued. Only changes to the net number of units associated with that permit application are recorded in subsequent records. For example, Building Permit Application Number [201601010001] located at [123 1st Avenue] was issued an [Initial TCO] Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on [January 1, 2018] approving 10 units for occupancy. Then, an [Amended TCO] was issued on [June 1, 2018] approving [5] additional units for occupancy, for a total of 15 new units associated with that Building Permit Application Number. The building will appear as twice in the dataset, each row representing when new units were approved.If additional or amended certifications are issued for a building permit application, but they do not change the number of units associated with that building permit application, those certifications are not recorded in this dataset. For example, if all new units associated with a project are certified for occupancy under an Initial TCO, then the Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) would not appear in the dataset because the CFC would not add new units to the housing stock.See data definitions for more details.C. UPDATE FREQUENCY This dataset is updated monthly.D. DOCUMENT TYPESSeveral documents issued near or at project completion can certify units for occupation. They are: Initial Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), Amended TCO, and Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). •\tInitial TCO is a document that allows for occupancy of a unit before final project completion is certified, conditional on if the unit can be occupied safely. The TCO is meant to be temporary and has an expiration date. This field represents the number of units certified for occupancy when the TCO is issued. •\tAmended TCO is a document that is issued when the conditions of the project are changed before final project completion is certified. These records show additional new units that have become habitable since the issuance of the Initial TCO. •\tCertificate of Final Completion (CFC) is a document that is issued when all work is completed according to approved plans, and the building is ready for complete occupancy. These records show additional new units that were not accounted for in the Initial or Amended TCOs.",

To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at districtattorney@sfgov.org.This dataset includes information on all cases presented to the District Attorney’s Office in which the office has taken action to prosecute a case, either by filing new criminal charges or by filing a motion to revoke probation or parole (MTR). This does not include cases in which the San Francisco Adult Probation Department or the state Division of Adult Parole Operations files a motion to revoke.For cases in which SFDA files a new criminal charge, the most serious offense type is categorized as the most serious offense for which SFDA prosecuted the defendant. For cases in which SFDA files an MTR, the most serious offense is categorized as the most serious offense for which the person was initially prosecuted. This is because a filing of an MTR means that new criminal charges were not filed for the new arresting offense, but rather that the District Attorney’s Office is seeking a new sanction as part of the sentence of a prior criminal conviction. For MTRs, the filing date is based on the date when SFDA filed the MTR for the new arrest.More information about this dataset can be found under the “Cases Prosecuted” section on the Data Dashboards pageDisclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.B.

SUMMARYThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by vaccination status over time, starting January 1, 2021. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected (the specimen collection date). Cases are counted in three categories: (1) all cases; (2) unvaccinated cases; and (3) completed primary series cases.1.\tAll cases: Includes cases among all San Francisco residents regardless of vaccination status.2.\tUnvaccinated cases: Cases are considered unvaccinated if their positive COVID-19 test was before receiving any vaccine. Cases that are not matched to a COVID-19 vaccination record are considered unvaccinated.3.\tCompleted primary series cases: Cases are considered completed primary series if their positive COVID-19 test was 14 days or more after they received their 2nd dose in a 2-dose COVID-19 series or the single dose of a 1-dose vaccine. These are also called “breakthrough cases.” On September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021. Data is lagged by eight days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is eight days prior to today. All data updates daily as more information becomes available.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDCase information is based on confirmed positive laboratory tests reported to the City. The City then completes quality assurance and other data verification processes.   Vaccination data comes from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2). The California Department of Public Health runs CAIR2. Individual-level case and vaccination data are matched to identify cases by vaccination status in this dataset. Case records are matched to vaccine records using first name, last name, date of birth, phone number, and email address.    We include vaccination records from all nine Bay Area counties in order to improve matching rates. This allows us to identify breakthrough cases among people who moved to the City from other Bay Area counties after completing their vaccine series. Only cases among San Francisco residents are included. C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 08:00 AM Pacific Time each day. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETTotal San Francisco population estimates can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). To identify total San Francisco population estimates, filter the view on “demographic_category_label” = “all ages”. Population estimates by vaccination status are derived from our publicly reported vaccination counts, which can be found at  COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time. The dataset includes new cases, 7-day average new cases, new case rates, 7-day average new case rates, percent of total cases, and 7-day average percent of total cases for each vaccination category. New cases are the count of cases where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in new cases. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the new cases for a particular day with the prior 6 days.New case rates are the count of new cases per 100,000 residents in each vaccination status group. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in case rates. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the case rate for a particular day with the prior six days. Percent of total new cases shows the percent of all cases on each day that were among a particular vaccination status.Here is more information on how each case rate is calculated: 1.\tThe case rate for all cases is equal to the number of new cases among all residents divided by the estimated total resident population. 2.\tUnvaccinated case rates are equal to the number of new cases among unvaccinated residents divided by the estimated number of unvaccinated residents. The estimated number of unvaccinated residents is calculated by subtracting the number of residents that have received at least one dose of a vaccine from the total estimated resident population.      3.\tCompleted primary series case rates are equal to the number of new cases among completed primary series residents divided by the estimated number of completed primary series residents. The estimated number of completed primary series residents is calculated by taking the number of residents who have completed their primary series over time and adding a 14-day delay to the “date_administered” column, to align with the definition of “Completed primary series cases” above. E. CHANGE LOG 6/28/2023 - data on cases by vaccination status are no longer being updated. This data is currently through 6/20/2023 (as of 6/28/2023) and will not include any new data after this date.  4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. 2/21/2023 - system updates to improve reliability and accuracy of cases data were implemented.1/31/2023 - updated “sf_population” column to reflect the 2020 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) San Francisco Population estimates. 1/31/2023 - renamed column “last_updated_at” to “data_as_of”. 1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented. 7/15/2022 - reinfections added to cases dataset.

We will be publishing a cumulative deaths by population characteristics dataset that will update moving forward.A. SUMMARYThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. Because of this, death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable.Population characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Death certificates are maintained by the California Department of Public Health.Data on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: *Case reports *Medical records *Electronic lab reports *Death certificates Data are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths. To protect resident privacy, we summarize COVID-19 data by only one characteristic at a time. Data are not shown until cumulative citywide deaths reach five or more.  Data notes on each population characteristic type is listed below. Race/ethnicity * We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.Gender* The City collects information on gender identity using these guidelines.C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 06:30 and 07:30 AM Pacific Time on Wednesday each week.Dataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). This dataset includes many different types of characteristics. Filter the “Characteristic Type” column to explore a topic area. Then, the “Characteristic Group” column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of deaths on each date. New deaths are the count of deaths within that characteristic group on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths in that characteristic group up to the date listed.This data may not be immediately available for more recent deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. To explore data on the total number of deaths, use the COVID-19 Deaths Over Time dataset.E. CHANGE LOG 9/11/2023 - on this date, we began using an updated definition of a COVID-19 death to align with the California Department of Public Health. This change was applied to COVID-19 deaths retrospectively beginning on 1/1/2023. More information about the recommendation by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists that motivated this change can be found here. 6/6/2023 - data on deaths by transmission type have been removed. See section ARCHIVED DATA for more detail.5/16/2023 - data on deaths by sexual orientation, comorbidities, homelessness, and single room occupancy have been removed. See section ARCHIVED DATA for more detail.4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. 1/31/2023 - column “population_estimate” added. 3/23/2022 - ‘Native American’ changed to ‘American Indian or Alaska Native’ to align with the census. 1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented.",

The data set includes the following categories: artist name, title of work, medium, dimensions and location. The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.C. UPDATE PROCESSDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the \"Cultural_District\" column and separated by a semicolon. This is because cultural districts can overlap.",

To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at districtattorney@sfgov.org.This dataset includes information on every arrest that has been presented to the SFDA since 2011 and the “action” decision made by the office on each, based on data from the SFDA’s internal case management system.After law enforcement has made an arrest for suspected criminal activity, the arresting agency presents its evidence to the District Attorney’s Office to determine what, if any, charges can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This prosecutorial decision to file or to reject arrest charges represents the first, and one of the most important, decisions of the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to either filing new charges or declining to file charges (“discharging” the arrest), the prosecutor may also take other actions, such as initiating a motion to revoke probation or parole, referring the case back to the arresting agency for further investigation, or referring the case to another criminal justice agency.More information about this dataset can be found under the “District Attorney Actions on Arrests Presented” section on the Data Dashboards pageDisclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDWhen an arrest is presented to the District Attorney’s office, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.C. UPDATE PROCESSWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week.

The City Survey was conducted every year from 1996 to 2004, and biennially from 2005 onward. The City Survey was not conducted in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed in 2023. Survey methodology was changed in 2015 from a mail to a phone survey, and expanded to include in-person and online options in 2023. Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution. Results should be weighted using the column \"weight\" in order to adjust for demographic differences between the City Survey sample and San Francisco's population. Please note that survey results were originally reported as unweighted until 1997. From 1997 onward, all City Survey results were reweighted with the exception of data from 2011. For ease of use, the column \"weight\" has been coded with a value of one for these years. A code book is also attached to this dataset under About > Attachments.

Areas within this boundary are highly likely to experience “deep and contiguous” flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. “Deep and contiguous flooding” means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as shoreline overtopping and overland inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean.In addition to the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map shows: •\t“Areas not served by the Combined Sewer and Stormwater Collection System” - showing where data for rainfall driven storm runoff is not available, and where flood risk has not been analyzed.•\t“Historical Shoreline”, “Historical Creeks”, and “Historical Waterbodies” - historical hydrology layers to illustrate the general topography of low-lying areas in the City.The Horizontal Datum used for the GIS layers is “NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_California_III_FIPS_0403_Ft_US.”Notes on UsageAt a minimum, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map is updated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) on an annual basis on or before July 1 to account for any parcel review requests that remove properties from the Flood Zone. To confirm the latest version of the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map, check the SFPUC website at https://sfpuc.org/learning/emergency-preparedness/flood-maps to see if the map has been updated since the date of this shapefile or if there have been any parcel review determinations that identify parcels that are no longer part of the 100-Year Flood Risk Zone. The most recent official map, associated documentation, and list of parcels removed from the map from a parcel review process are available at https://sfpuc.org/learning/emergency-preparedness/flood-maps. Please be advised that the parcels listed are no longer considered to be within the 100-Year Flood Risk Zone as a result of the parcel review process. As of July 2022, this list is updated on an ongoing basis. Check the SFPUC website for any changes to this schedule.The boundaries of this zone align with San Francisco parcel boundaries. The user should confirm proper projection or use of the webmap at https://sfpuc.org/learning/emergency-preparedness/flood-maps to properly identify parcels within the flood zone.",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.In recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)Percentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020Mar - 33.6%Apr - 25.9%May - 11.1%Jun - 7.2%Jul - 5.8%Aug - 5.4%Sep - 5.1%Oct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%To protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).Tests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.This data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-case-maps#new-cases-mapsB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by analysis neighborhood and specimen collection date.Data are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Due to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"specimen_collection_date\".Calculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Percent positivity indicates how widespread COVID-19 is in San Francisco and it helps public health officials determine if we are testing enough given the number of people who are testing positive. When there are fewer than 20 positives tests for a given neighborhood and time period, the positivity rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable. Calculating Testing Rates: To calculate the testing rate per 10,000 residents, divide the total number of tests collected (positive, negative, and indeterminate results) for neighborhood by the total number of residents who live in that neighborhood (included in the dataset), then multiply by 10,000. When there are fewer than 20 total tests for a given neighborhood and time period, the testing rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable.

    "description": "Effective January 1, 2015, an individual who qualifies as a permit consultant under San Francisco law must register and file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a \"major project\" or a \"minor project\", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services. \"Permit consulting services\" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. \"Permit consulting services\" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit. A \"major project\" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A \"minor project\" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.The following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report: -a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer; -a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or -an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization. Each permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services. Quarterly disclosure reports must subsequently be filed with the Ethics Commission",

To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at districtattorney@sfgov.org.This data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney’s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).A case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney’s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".More information about this dataset can be found under the “Case Resolutions” section on the Data Dashboards pageDisclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney’s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.C. UPDATE PROCESSWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.D.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThe San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)  Stop Data was designed to capture information to comply with the Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA), or  California Assembly Bill (AB)953. SFPD officers collect specific information on each stop, including elements of the stop, circumstances and the perceived identity characteristics of the individual(s) stopped. The information obtained by officers is reported to the California Department of Justice. This dataset includes data on stops starting on July 1st, 2018, which is when the data collection program went into effect. Read the detailed overview for this dataset here.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDBy the end of each shift, officers enter all stop data into the Stop Data Collection System, which is automatically submitted to the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ). Once a quarter the Department receives a stops data file from CA DOJ. The SFPD conducts several transformations of this data to ensure privacy, accuracy and compliance with State law and regulation. For increased usability, text descriptions have also been added for several data fields which include numeric codes (including traffic, suspicion, citation, and custodial arrest offense codes, and actions taken as a result of a stop). See the data dictionaries below for explanations of all coded data fields. Read more about the data collection, and transformation, including geocoding and PII cleaning processes, in the detailed overview of this dataset.C. UPDATE PROCESSInformation is updated on a quarterly basis. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis dataset includes information about police stops that occurred, including some details about the person(s) stopped, and what happened during the stop. Each row is a person stopped with a record identifier for the stop and a unique identifier for the person. A single stop may involve multiple people and may produce more than one associated unique identifier for the same record identifier. A certain percentage of stops have stop information that can’t be geocoded. This may be due to errors in data input at the officer level (typos in entry or providing an address that doesn't exist). More often, this is due to officers providing a level of detail that isn't codable to a geographic coordinate - most often at the Airport (ie: Terminal 3, door 22.) In these cases, the location of the stops is coded as unknown.E. DATA DICTIONARIES CJIS Offense Codes data look up table Look up table for other coded data fields",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis dataset includes San Francisco COVID-19 tests by race/ethnicity and by date. This dataset represents the daily count of tests collected, and the breakdown of test results (positive, negative, or indeterminate). Tests in this dataset include all those collected from persons who listed San Francisco as their home address at the time of testing. It also includes tests that were collected by San Francisco providers for persons who were missing a locating address. This dataset does not include tests for residents listing a locating address outside of San Francisco, even if they were tested in San Francisco. The data were de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). If a person tested multiple times on the same date, only one test is included from that date. When there are multiple tests on the same date, a positive result, if one exists, will always be selected as the record for the person. If a PCR and antigen test are taken on the same day, the PCR test will supersede. If a person tests multiple times on the same day and the results are all the same (e.g. all negative or all positive) then the first test done is selected as the record for the person.The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.When a person gets tested for COVID-19, they may be asked to report information about themselves. One piece of information that might be requested is a person's race and ethnicity. These data are often incomplete in the laboratory and provider reports of the test results sent to the health department. The data can be missing or incomplete for several possible reasons:\t• The person was not asked about their race and ethnicity.\t• The person was asked, but refused to answer.\t• The person answered, but the testing provider did not include the person's answers in the reports.\t• The testing provider reported the person's answers in a format that could not be used by the health department.For any of these reasons, a person's race/ethnicity will be recorded in the dataset as “Unknown.”B. NOTE ON RACE/ETHNICITYThe different values for Race/Ethnicity in this dataset are \"Asian;\" \"Black or African             American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native                           Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" \"White;\" \"Multi-racial;\" \"Other;\" and “Unknown.\"The Race/Ethnicity categorization increases data clarity by emulating the methodology used by the U.S. Census in the American Community Survey. Specifically, persons who identify as \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" \"White,\" \"Multi-racial,\" or \"Other\" do NOT include any person who identified as Hispanic/Latino at any time in their testing reports that either (1) identified them as SF residents or (2) as someone who tested without a locating address by an SF provider. All persons across all races who identify as Hispanic/Latino are recorded as “\"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races.\" This categorization increases data accuracy by correcting the way “Other” persons were counted. Previously, when a person reported “Other” for Race/Ethnicity, they would be recorded “Unknown.” Under the new categorization, they are counted as “Other” and are distinct from “Unknown.”If a person records their race/ethnicity as “Asian,” “Black or African American,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” “White,” or “Other” for their first COVID-19 test, then this data will not change—even if a different race/ethnicity is reported for this person for any future COVID-19 test. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception is if a person’s race/ethnicity value is reported as “Unknown” on their first test and then on a subsequent test they report “Asian;” \"Black or African American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" or \"White”, then this subsequent reported race/ethnicity will overwrite the previous recording of “Unknown”. If a person has only ever selected “Unknown” as their race/ethnicity, then it will be recorded as “Unknown.” This change provides more specific and actionable data on who is tested in San Francisco.The second exception is if a person ever marks “Hispanic or Latino/a, all races” for race/ethnicity then this choice will always overwrite any previous or future response. This is because it is an overarching category that can include any and all other races and is mutually exclusive with the other responses.A person's race/ethnicity will be recorded as “Multi-racial” if they select two or more values among the following choices: “Asian,” “Black or African American,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” “White,” or “Other.” If a person selects a combination of two or more race/ethnicity answers that includes “Hispanic or Latino/a, all races” then they will still be recorded as “Hispanic or Latino/a, all races”—not as “Multi-racial.”C. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. D. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 5:00AM Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 7:00AM and 9:00AM in case of pipeline failure.E. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).Due to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24, 2020 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a user can analyze this data by sorting or filtering by the \"specimen_collection_date\" field.Calculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. When there are fewer than 20 positives tests for a given race/ethnicity and time period, the positivity rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable. Calculating Testing Rates: To calculate the testing rate per 10,000 residents, divide the total number of tests collected (positive, negative, and indeterminate results) for the specified race/ethnicity by the total number of residents who identify as that race/ethnicity (according to the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimate), then multiply by 10,000. When there are fewer than 20 total tests for a given race/ethnicity and time period, the testing rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable.

Some metrics do not include values for all fields or fiscal years. Some results for the latest fiscal year are unavailable because of known lags in reporting. Users should review any data notes reported for each row for guidance about interpreting values. All values are reported as numbers without formatting, but the column [Measure Data Type] describes the intended format. For example, a value appearing as “0.50” with [Measure Data Type] reported as “Percent” should be displayed as “50%”.",

Boundaries in this map were decided using data from the 2020 Census on the number of people living in each census block in the City and County. This data includes the number of individuals incarcerated in facilities under the control of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation based on their last known residential address. This information is made available by the Statewide Database based on U.S. Census Bureau Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171).These map boundaries were trimmed to align with the city and county's physical boundaries for greater usability. This trimming mainly consisted of excluding the water around the City and County from the boundaries.C. UPDATE PROCESSSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor Districts reflected in this dataset will remain unchanged until after the next Decennial Census in 2030. A new dataset will be created after the next Decennial Census and redistricting process are completed.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThese data represent hate crimes reported by the SFPD to the California Department of Justice. Read the detailed overview of this dataset here.What is a Hate Crime? A hate crime is a crime against a person, group, or property motivated by the victim's real or perceived protected social group. An individual may be the victim of a hate crime if they have been targeted because of their actual or perceived: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3) nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, and/or (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Hate crimes are serious crimes that may result in imprisonment or jail time.  B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDHow is a Hate Crime Processed?  Not all prejudice incidents including the utterance of hate speech rise to the level of a hate crime.  The U.S. Constitution allows hate speech if it does not interfere with the civil rights of others. While these acts are certainly hurtful, they do not rise to the level of criminal violations and thus may not be prosecuted. When a prejudice incident is reported, the reporting officer conducts a preliminary investigation and writes a crime or incident report. Bigotry must be the central motivation for an incident to be determined to be a hate crime. In that report, all facts such as verbatims or statements that occurred before or after the incident and characteristics such as the race, ethnicity, sex, religion, or sexual orientations of the victim and suspect (if known) are included. To classify a prejudice incident, the San Francisco Police Department’s Hate Crimes Unit of the Special Investigations Division conducts an analysis of the incident report to determine if the incident falls under the definition of a “hate crime” as defined by state law. California Penal Code 422.55 - Hate Crime DefinitionC. UPDATE PROCESSThese data are updated monthly. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis dataset includes the following information about each incident: the hate crime offense, bias type, location/time, and the number of hate crime victims and suspects. The data presented mirrors data published by the California Department of Justice, albeit at a higher frequency. The publishing of these data meet requirements set forth in PC 13023.E.

    "description": "Effective January 1, 2015, an individual who qualifies as a permit consultant under San Francisco law must register and file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a \"major project\" or a \"minor project\", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services. \"Permit consulting services\" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. \"Permit consulting services\" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit. A \"major project\" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A \"minor project\" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.The following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report: -a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer; -a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or -an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization. Each permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services. Quarterly disclosure reports must subsequently be filed with the Ethics Commission",

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner releases a monthly report containing the previous month’s preliminary count of unintentional fatal drug overdoses. This dataset is manually updated based on that report. The San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) investigates any unknown cause of death for deaths that occur in San Francisco. OCME uses drug testing, death scene investigation, autopsy, medical record, and informant information to determine the cause of death. Preliminary determinations are generally based on drug testing and death scene investigations. Preliminary deaths reported by the medical examiner consist of two categories: (a) cases that are still under investigation and involve suspected acute toxicity from opioids, cocaine, or methamphetamine; and (b) cases that have been finalized and were attributed to acute toxicity from any substance (including prescribed medication and over-the-counter medication).  C. UPDATE PROCESS This dataset is updated monthly following the release of the monthly accidental fatal drug overdose report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Department of Public Health staff manually copy data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner’s report to update this dataset.  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET This dataset is updated each month to include the most recent month’s preliminary accidental fatal drug overdose count. Counts from previous months are often also updated as it can take more than a month for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to finish reviewing cases.  E.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis table contains all parties involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD’s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.The crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. For example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. C. UPDATE PROCESSAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analysis, interpretation, or communication.This dataset can also be queried on the TransBASE Dashboard. TransBASE is a geospatially enabled database maintained by SFDPH that currently includes over 200 spatially referenced variables from multiple agencies and across a range of geographic scales, including infrastructure, transportation, zoning, sociodemographic, and collision data, all linked to an intersection or street segment. TransBASE facilitates a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing transportation-related health issues,informed by a large and growing evidence base regarding the importance of transportation system design and land use decisions for health. TransBASE’s purpose is to inform public and private efforts to improve transportation system safety, sustainability, community health and equity in San Francisco.E.

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.• Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.• Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.• Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.The survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.All survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the “weight” field when appropriate in your analysis.The survey period for this survey is as follows:2019: May - August 2019The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.At the 95% confidence level is:• n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%• n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%• n = 100. Margin of error = +/- 9.80%",

Bike counts for 2012 are not included in this file, as they are not available/unable to be located. One empty feature from the original “citywide_manual_bicycle_count_locations” (feature 50) was deleted.",

An officer must file Form SFEC-3610(b) any time a behested payment of $1,000 or more is made at his or her behest by an interested party. An “interested party” is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.The filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.If the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.If the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.Finally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.Each row on this table represents the contents of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

Note: Not all lands are within the City and County proper. The City owns properties outside of its boundaries, including lands managed by SF Recreation and Parks, SF Public Utilities Commission, and other agencies.  Certain lands are managed by following agencies which are not directly part of the City and County of San Francisco, but are included here for reference: San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA), San Francisco Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII), and City College of San Francisco.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe Enterprise GIS program in the Department of Technology is the technical custodian of the FSR. This team creates and maintains this dataset in conjunction with the Real Estate Division and the Capital Planning Program of the City Administrator’s Office, who act as the primary business data stewards for this data. C. UPDATE PROCESSThere are a handful of events that may trigger changes to this dataset:1. The sale of a property2. The leasing of a property3. The purchase of a property4. The change in jurisdiction of a property (e.g. from MTA to DPW)5. The removal or improvement of the propertyEach of these changes triggers a workflow that updates the FSR. The Real Estate Division and Capital Planning make updates on an ongoing basis. The full dataset is reviewed quarterly to ensure nothing is missing or needs to be corrected. Updates to the data, once approved, are immediately reflected in the internal system and are updated here in the open dataset on a monthly basis.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETSee here for an interactive map of all the City lands in this dataset. To track the facilities on City lands, join this dataset to the City Facilities dataset using the land_id field. If you see an error in the data, you can submit a change request with the relevant information to dtis.helpdesk@sfgov.org.

The columns in this dataset correspond to the figures reported on the summary page of FPPC forms 450, 460, 461, and 465. Refer to the FPPC Forms represented in this dataset.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.If a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.C. UPDATE PROCESSEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETTransactions from rejected and superseded filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.A row with no value in the SyncFlag column indicates a paper filing amended an electronic filing. The SFEC is working on how to automatically deal with these cases.Properties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.Refer to the Ethics Commission's webpage for more information.RELATED DATASETS    San Francisco Campaign Filers    Filings Received by SFEC    Summary Totals    Transactions",

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset comes from the San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency and includes all opioid overdose-related 911 calls responded to by emergency medical services (ambulances). The purpose of this dataset is to show how many opioid overdose-related 911 calls the San Francisco Fire Department and other ambulance companies respond to each week. This dataset is based on ambulance patient care records and not 911 calls for service data. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED The San Francisco Fire Department and other ambulance companies send electronic patient care reports to the California Emergency Medical Services Agency for all 911 calls they respond to. The San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency (SF EMSA) has access to the state database that includes all reports for 911 calls in San Francisco County. In order to identify overdose-related calls that resulted in an emergency medical service (or ambulance) response, SF EMSA filters the patient care reports based on set criteria used in other jurisdictions called The Rhode Island Criteria. These criteria filter calls to only include those calls where EMS documented that an opioid overdose was involved and/or naloxone (Narcan) was administered. Calls that do not involve an opioid overdose are filtered out of the dataset. Calls that result in a patient death on scene are also filtered out of the dataset. This dataset is created by copying the total number of calls each week when the state makes this data available.  C. UPDATE PROCESS Data is generally available with a 24-hour lag on a weekly frequency but the exact lag and update frequency is based on when the State makes this data available.  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET This dataset includes the total number of calls a week. The week starts on a Sunday and ends on the following Saturday. This dataset will not match the Fire Department Calls for Service dataset, as this dataset has been filtered to include only opioid overdose-related 911 calls based on electronic patient care report data. Additionally, the Fire Department Calls for Service data are primarily based on 911 call data (i.e. calls triaged and recorded by San Francisco’s 911 call center) and not the finalized electronic patient care reports recorded by Fire Department paramedics.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYSan Francisco’s Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance requires owners of non-residential buildings over 10,000 square feet to annually benchmark and disclose energy performance. On behalf of City agencies, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) benchmarks and reports energy use for a portfolio of approximately 500 public facilities buildings. The performance of public facilities can be examined in an interactive report at bit.ly/SFMunicipalBenchmarking, and annual reports from 2011-present are available there as well. This dataset presents the energy performance and basic characteristics for public facilities that is visualized by the SFPUC’s interactive report.   In addition, energy performance data for non-municipal buildings (i.e. commercial buildings of 10,000 square feet or larger, and multifamily & mixed-use buildings of 50,000 square feet or larger) is available at: bit.ly/ExistingBuildingsReportB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDIn compliance with California Energy Benchmarking Regulations (CA Public Resources Code Section 25402.10 and CCR Title 20 Section 1680), and San Francisco Existing Buildings Energy Ordinance (Environment Code Chapter 20), the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission provides energy benchmarking services on behalf of municipal facilities. Details for public facilities are compiled from city records, and energy usage is compiled from utility records; related metrics such as energy use intensity are calculated from the combination of such records. Data is subjected to quality assurance validation prior to publication. For additional information regarding data sources and assumptions, please review the \"Data Sources and Assumptions\" page of the Municipal Facilities Energy Benchmarking dashboard: https://bit.ly/SFMunicipalBenchmarking.C.

SUMMARYThe Department of Public Health and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, with support from the Planning Department, created these 41 neighborhoods by grouping 2010 Census tracts, using common real estate and residents’ definitions for the purpose of providing consistency in the analysis and reporting of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and data on City-funded programs and services. These neighborhoods are not codified in Planning Code nor Administrative Code, although this map is referenced in Planning Code Section 415 as the “American Community Survey Neighborhood Profile Boundaries Map.Note: These are NOT statistical boundaries as they are not controlled for population size. This is also NOT an official map of neighborhood boundaries in SF but an aggregation of Census tracts and should be used in conjunction with other spatial boundaries for decision making.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThis dataset is produced by assigning Census tracts to neighborhoods based on existing neighborhood definitions used by Planning and MOHCD. A qualitative assessment is made to identify the appropriate neighborhood for a given tract based on understanding of population distribution and significant landmarks. Once all tracts have been assigned a neighborhood, the tracts are dissolved to produce this dataset, Analysis Neighborhoods.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is static. Changes to the analysis neighborhood boundaries will be evaluated as needed by the Analysis Neighborhood working group led by DataSF and the Planning department and includes staff from various other city departments. Contact usfor any questions.D.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis table contains all victims (parties who are injured) involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD’s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.The crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. For example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table).B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. C. UPDATE PROCESSAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analysis, interpretation, or communication.This dataset can also be queried on the TransBASE Dashboard. TransBASE is a geospatially enabled database maintained by SFDPH that currently includes over 200 spatially referenced variables from multiple agencies and across a range of geographic scales, including infrastructure, transportation, zoning, sociodemographic, and collision data, all linked to an intersection or street segment. TransBASE facilitates a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing transportation-related health issues,informed by a large and growing evidence base regarding the importance of transportation system design and land use decisions for health. TransBASE’s purpose is to inform public and private efforts to improve transportation system safety, sustainability, community health and equity in San Francisco.E.

This dataset is created using data from the California Electronic Death Registration System (CA-EDRS) via the Vital Records Business Intelligence System (VRBIS). Substance-related deaths are identified by reviewing the cause of death. Deaths caused by opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine are included. Homicides and suicides are excluded. Ethnic and racial groups with fewer than 10 events are not tallied separately for privacy reasons but are included in the “all races” total.   Unintentional drug overdose death rates are calculated by dividing the total number of overdose deaths by race/ethnicity by the total population size for that demographic group and year and then multiplying by 100,000. The total population size is based on estimates from the US Census Bureau County Population Characteristics for San Francisco, 2022 Vintage by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. These data differ from the data shared in the  Preliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Death by Year dataset  since this dataset uses finalized counts of overdose deaths associated with cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids only.

An officer must file Form SFEC-3610(b) any time a behested payment of $1,000 or more is made at his or her behest by an interested party. An “interested party” is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.The filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.If the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.If the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.Finally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.Each row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

This dataset identifies locations where these strategies could have the highest benefitto community health and make the most effective use of City investment.SF Public Works mapped a combination of environmental and health data to identify the priority zones. The study layers exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), satellite temperature readings from a recent heat wave, and tree canopy data to identify where exposure is the highest. To further refine the prioritization zone, data was added for residents experiencing asthma or diabetes hospitalizationswhich are both exacerbated by heat and air quality issues. This created two final maps focused on heat and air quality that combine environmental data and human health. These maps were combined to produce the final priority zones.",

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Data provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series.  B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED Information on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. In order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily via automated process  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Before analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column.  For example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.  If you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). If you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"total_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"total_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"total_primary_series_doses\" column.  To count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, use the \"total_booster_recipients\" and \"total_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose, use the \"total_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered, use the \"total_booster_doses\" or \"total_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  E.

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset includes data on a variety of substance use services funded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). This dataset only includes Drug MediCal-certified residential treatment, withdrawal management, and methadone treatment. Other private non-Drug Medi-Cal treatment providers may operate in the city. Withdrawal management discharges are inclusive of anyone who left withdrawal management after admission and may include someone who left before completing withdrawal management. This dataset also includes naloxone distribution from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Naloxone Clearinghouse and the SFDPH-funded Drug Overdose Prevention and Education program. Both programs distribute naloxone to various community-based organizations who then distribute naloxone to their program participants. Programs may also receive naloxone from other sources. Data from these other sources is not included in this dataset. Finally, this dataset includes the number of clients on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The number of people who were treated with methadone at a Drug Medi-Cal certified Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) by year is populated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Behavioral Health Services Quality Management (BHSQM) program. OTPs in San Francisco are required to submit patient billing data in an electronic medical record system called Avatar. BHSQM calculates the number of people who received methadone annually based on Avatar data. Data only from Drug MediCal certified OTPs were included in this dataset. The number of people who receive buprenorphine by year is populated from the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), administered by the California Department of Justice. All licensed prescribers in California are required to document controlled substance prescriptions in CURES. The Center on Substance Use and Health calculates the total number of people who received a buprenorphine prescription annually based on CURES data. Formulations of buprenorphine that are prescribed only for pain management are excluded.  People may receive buprenorphine and methadone in the same year, so you cannot add the Buprenorphine Clients by Year, and Methadone Clients by Year data together to get the total number of unique people receiving medications for opioid use disorder. For more information on where to find treatment in San Francisco, visit findtreatment-sf.org.  B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED This dataset is created by copying the data into this dataset from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Quality Management Program, the California Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), and the Office of Overdose Prevention. C. UPDATE PROCESS Residential Substance Use Treatment, Withdrawal Management, Methadone, and Naloxone data are updated quarterly with a 45-day delay. Buprenorphine data are updated quarterly and when the state makes this data available, usually at a 5-month delay. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET Throughout the year this dataset may include partial year data for methadone and buprenorphine treatment. As both methadone and buprenorphine are used as long-term treatments for opioid use disorder, many people on treatment at the end of one calendar year will continue into the next. For this reason, doubling (methadone), or quadrupling (buprenorphine) partial year data will not accurately project year-end totals.  E.

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco summarized by the geographic region of their residential address. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco).  Data provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series.  B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED Information on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals’ residential addresses is recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) then runs additional processes to spatially match each address to a geographical region. In order to estimate the percent of San Francisco residents vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each analysis neighborhood. C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily via automated process  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET San Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). This data is grouped by SF residents’ analysis neighborhoods of residence. To query counts of individuals vaccinated by analysis neighborhood, filter to \"area_type\" = ‘Analysis Neighborhood’, and \"id\" will contain the analysis neighborhood name. To query summarized counts of all vaccinated individuals in San Francisco and whether the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) was able to match their residential address to a location, filter to \"area_type\" = ‘Summary’. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"count_vaccinated\" column. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), use the \"count_vaccinated_by_dph\" column.  To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"count_series_completed\" column. To count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) boosters, use the \"count_received_booster\" and \"count_received_2nd_booster\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received at least one bivalent booster, use the \"count_received_bivalent_booster\" columns. E. ARCHIVED DATA A previous version of this dataset was archived on 10/27/2022. For historical purposes, you can access the archived dataset at the following link:  ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Vaccines Given to San Franciscans by GeographyF.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYTo confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the Sheriff's Office at sheriff.tech.services@sfgov.org The dataset provides summary information on individuals booked into the San Francisco City and County Jail since 2012, categorized by Male/Female. The table provides a breakdown of the total number of bookings by month and Male/Female. The unit of measure is the jail booking number. The data is collected by the Sheriff's Office and includes self-reported and assigned data. The booking process refers to the procedure that occurs after an individual has been arrested and is taken into custody. The process begins with the arrest of an individual by law enforcement officers. The arrest can take place on the scene or at a later time if a warrant is issued. Once the individual has been arrested, and statutory law requires incarceration, they would be transported to the jail for booking. The arresting officer will record the reason for the arrest, along with any other relevant information. The sheriff’s deputies will then book the individual into jail, which involves taking their fingerprints, photograph, and recording personal information. The jail will assign a booking number, which is used to identify the individual throughout their time in custody. Once the booking process is complete, the individual will be incarcerated and will remain in custody until they are released per court order.Disclaimer: The San Francisco Sheriff's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDWhen an arrest is presented to the Sheriff’s Office, relevant data is manually entered into the Sheriff Office's jail management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, and added to Open Data.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is scheduled to update monthlyD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data can be used to identify trends and patterns in the jail population over time. The date in this dataset is based on the date the suspect was booked into county jail for the arresting incident. The unit of measurement for this dataset is the booking number. A jail booking number is a unique identifier assigned to each individual who is booked into a jail facility. It is used to track the individual throughout their time in custody and to link their records to other relevant information, such as court appearances and medical records. E.

Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.B. METHODOLOGY  Manually updated.

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset was first created as part of the SFMTA On Street Car Share Pilot Program (approved by the MTA Board in July 2013) to illustrate the location of implemented and planned (various stages) spaces throughout the city.B. METHODOLOGY  The locations were originally provided to the MTA as requests by the three car share organizations (CSOs). These were given as a .kml file, which was converted to a .shp. Additional fields were created using spatial joins (zipcode, supervisor district, CNN, etc). Use definition query tool to display those locations with a certain attribute. For example, query Existing = 1 to display those locations that are on street operating. 500 submissions were given by CSOs to the MTA, but only a portion of those were brought to the MTA Board for approval, and even fewer were implemented as operational on street spaces. With no definition query, you can see all spaces as features, with varying levels of data completion. C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  During periods of implementation/construction, updates were as frequent as daily or weekly. However, as the frequency of newly implemented spaces slowed over the course of the pilot, updates occurred less frequently--weekly or monthly. Updates will be needed as new spaces are implemented--many of the spaces not taken past MTA Board approval have incomplete data.  D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Each feature (or each row, or point) represents a single car share parking space. Some parking spaces belong to a \"pod\" where there are two adjacent car share parking spaces, indicated by the \"PodType\" field. To summarize or analyze by pod, use the \"POD\" field.",

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset represents all San Francisco (SF) residents who have received a vaccine for certain respiratory viruses that circulate more heavily in the fall and winter months. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, even if they received their vaccination elsewhere in California. The data are broken down by demographic and geographical stratifications. COVID-19:This dataset represents all SF residents who are considered up to date on their COVID-19 vaccine. A person is up to date if they have received at least one dose of the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine.  The specific up-to-date criteria can be found on the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) website.  (Note: As of November 2024, this dataset only contains data regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. This documentation will be updated as other seasonal vaccination data is added). B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED Information on doses administered to those who live in SF is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2), run by CDPH. The information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.  In order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group and analysis neighborhood.C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily via automated process.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET SF population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. SF population estimates for analysis neighborhoods can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Geography Census dataset. Both of these views use population estimates from the 2018-2022 5-year ACS.  Before analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the “vaccine_type” and \"demographic_group\" columns. For example, filtering “vaccine_type” to “COVID-19” will allow you to only look at rows corresponding to COVID-19 vaccinations. Filtering “demographic_subgroup” to “Analysis Neighborhood” will allow you to only look at rows corresponding to SF neighborhoods. You can then calculate the percentages of those up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations by neighborhood. The “vaccine_subtype” field provides information about the current vaccine product being tracked in this dataset.E. CHANGE LOG11/5/2024 - Dataset updated to reflect up to date status for the 2024-2025 monovalent formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine.7/2/2024 - Population estimates were updated to reflect the most recent ACS data.",

    "description": "A.\tSUMMARYThis dataset shows the amount of nighttime engine high power run-ups from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. by air carrier operations using jet and regional jet aircraft.  Power run-up activities are conducted at designated locations on the airfield, furthest from residential communities, and monitored by SFO to manage nighttime noise. A power run-up is a procedure used to test an aircraft engine or aircraft system after maintenance or repair is performed. The aircraft engines' throttle settings can range from ground idle to high power and the length of the operational checks may vary in duration. These checks are required to ensure normal operating standards are met, prior to returning the aircraft to service.B.\tHOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDetails of each power run-up are logged into the Airport Operations System. It serves to help quantify, analyze, and report on power run-up activities in support of programs to reduce aircraft noise in communities surrounding SFO.C.\tUPDATE PROCESSData is available starting in January 2005 and will be updated monthly.D.\tHOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis information is the data source used in producing the Nighttime Power Run-ups section (page 4) of the Airport Director’s Reports. These reports are presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-reportPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.E.\tRELATED DATASETSOther related datasets are Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Runway Usage, Flight Operations, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Noise Exceedance Rating.Data is available starting in January 2005 and will be updated monthly.",

Developers must file five forms with the Ethics Commission over the course of about a year disclosing donations to nonprofit organizations that have contacted City officials about their project. The first form is due within 30 days of certification of an Environmental Impact Report (\"EIR\") by a local agency or, if the project relies on a program EIR, within 30 days of the adoption of a final environmental determination under the California Environmental Quality Act. Disclosure is not required for a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. A disclosure report must be completed and filed by the developer of any \"major project.\" A major project is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 where either: The Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies an Environmental Impact Review (\"EIR\") for the project under the California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\"); or The project relies on a program EIR and the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts any final environmental determination under CEQA. (See below to determine when a final environmental determination is adopted.)A major project does not include a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. For purposes of this filing requirement, a \"developer\" includes the individual or entity that is the project sponsor responsible for filing a completed Environmental Evaluation Application (\"EEA\") with the Planning Department (or other lead agency) under CEQA. However, if an individual who signs and submits the EEA will not be responsible for obtaining the entitlements or developing the major project, the developer is instead the individual or entity that is responsible for obtaining such entitlements. A developer must use the SFEC 3500 form to file a total of five reports with the Ethics Commission with respect to each major project. The first (or initial) report must be filed within 30 days of the date the Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies the EIR for that project or, for a major project relying on a program EIR, within 30 days of the date that the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts a final environmental determination under CEQA. The developer must also use this form to file four subsequent quarterly reports, beginning with the quarter in which in the initial report is filed. The due dates for the quarterly reports are: April 15 for the period starting January 1 and ending March 31; July 15 for the period starting April 1 and ending June 30;October 15 for the period starting July 1 and ending September 30; and January 15 for the period starting October 1 and ending December 31.",

Visit SFPL's San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database for a keyword searchable interface and links to Voter Information pamphlets.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDSan Francisco Public Library received a Library Services and Technology grant to finance the digital scanning and microfilming of the Library's print collection of voter information pamphlets and handbooks for San Francisco municipal elections. Although not complete, the collection dates back to 1907. Approximately 59,000 voter pamphlet pages, including 1,500 propositions, were digitized into PDF files. For some elections, separate pamphlets were created for each voting district or a combination of each voting district and political party, and there is no singular representative pamphlet which includes all of the candidates for that election. As a result, the hard copies of the various pamphlets were bound together to represent that particular election, and this resulted in extra-large digitized versions. Because the PDF files of the voter pamphlets are images instead of text, they cannot be searched electronically. San Francisco Public Library staff developed the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database to provide keyword access to San Francisco propositions, pass/fail outcomes and other information, and links to the full-text PDF Voter Information Pamphlet. C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is updated when the final election results from the San Francisco Department of Elections are available.D.

SUMMARY This dataset includes completed and partially completed building permits that have resulted in the addition or loss of residential units since 2005, through construction of new units, demolition of existing units, or alteration of existing residential structures. This dataset also includes the number of affordable (below market rate) units by their affordability levels. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED This data is primarily based on unit-changing permits in DBI’s permit tracking system (PTS). It also includes occasional records related to housing developments that don’t fall under DBI’s purview (e.g. developments on State lands). The completion of permits is determined in different ways: 1) DBI’s data on the issuance of Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), which covers the majority of housing unit completions since 2018 2) Permit complete status in DBI’s Permit Tracking System, 3) manual review of Planning Department’s legacy Housing Inventory data going back to 2005. Data on the affordability of units is primarily obtained from MOHCD’s Affordable Pipeline and Affordable Portfolio. When exact data on AMI levels is not available, but the total number of affordable units is known, the AMI levels are estimated based on similar projects. This data is maintained in Planning Department’s Housing Information System. C. UPDATE PROCESS The Planning Department’s Data and Analytics Group (DAG) updates this dataset annually on April 1. The underlying data for this dataset is maintained and updated in Planning Department’s Housing Information System, which is updated through automated data pipelines every day. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET This dataset can be used to track housing production trends in San Francisco. Note that the first and latest completion dates are often the same because, for most permits, all units are deemed complete at the same time. But if units of a permit are completed at different times (through multiple TCOs/CFC) these dates show the first TCO date and the latest TCO, CFC, or PTS completion date. The latest completion date is not necessarily the same as the final completion date, as the permit may be partially completed, and more units could be expected to be completed in the future. E.

    "description": "In early February 2024, we will be retiring the Mpox Case Summary dataset. This dataset will be archived and no longer update. A historic record of this data will remain available.A. SUMMARYThis dataset represents probable and confirmed mpox cases per CDC case definitions among San Francisco residents reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Data are lagged by 4 days, based on the most recent date a case is received by the source system.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported.These data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. Data are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.To ensure data privacy, we suppress data when cumulative counts are between 1-4. The exception to this rule is for the response option “Unknown” which does not provide any identifying information. If only one response option has a count <5 we also suppress the response option with the second lowest count (including “Unknown” or a response option with a count of 0). If the second lowest response option is 0, both response options will display “<5”. If the second lowest response option is a number greater than 0 both response options will display “< [sum of two lowest counts]”.Data notes for population characteristic types are listed below. Race/ethnicity* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. Gender* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. Sexual orientation* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown/Declined\" refers to a lack of data or those who did not disclose their sexual orientation.* The response option “Gay, Lesbian, or Same-Gender Loving” is a standard reporting option and cannot be split into individual categories. This is a limitation of the data from the source system. Sexual contact during incubation period* We track whether mpox cases had sexual contact during the 21 days prior to symptom(s) onset. This timeframe is the incubation period.* The response option \"Unknown/Declined\" refers to a lack of data or those who did not disclose their sexual contact history.For convenience, we provide  the 2020 5-year American Community Survey population estimates.C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes Monday through Friday.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis dataset shows total cases (probable and confirmed) by population characteristics. Filter the “characteristic_type” column to explore a topic area. Then, the “characteristic_group” column shows each group or category within that topic area and the total count of cases identified within that population subgroup.E.

    "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. Data provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series.  B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED Information on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. In order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group. C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily via automated process  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Before analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column.  For example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.  If you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). If you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column.  To count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  To count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" E. ARCHIVED DATA A previous version of this dataset was archived on 10/27/2022. For historical purposes, you can access the archived dataset at the following link:  ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics Over TimeF. CHANGE LOG 11/1/2023 - data on COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by demographics over time are no longer being updated. This data is currently through 10/31/2023 and will not include any new data after this date.1/31/2023 - updated “subgroup_population” column to reflect the 2020 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) San Francisco Population estimates. 10/27/2022 - the columns \"age_group\" and \"age_group_population\" were removed. To continue to access data by age eligibility groups, filter the dataset on \"demographic_group\" = ‘Age Group’. The column \"overall_segment\" was altered to reflect this change. 10/27/2022 - the columns \"new_1st_doses\", \"new_2nd_doses\", and \"new_single_doses\" were removed and consolidated into the column \"new_primary_series_doses\" (which also includes 3rd doses for the Pfizer Under 5 series). Similarly, the columns \"cumulative_1st_doses\", \"cumulative_2nd_doses\", \"cumulative_single_doses\", were replaced by \"cumulative_primary_series_doses\".",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYBeginning in 2022, the law requires owners of residential housing units in San Francisco to report certain information about their units to the San Francisco Rent Board on an annual basis.  For units (other than condominium units) in buildings of 10 residential units or more, owners were required to begin reporting this information to the Rent Board by July 1, 2022, with updates due on March 1, 2023 and every March 1 thereafter. For condominium units and units in buildings with less than 10 residential units, reporting began on March 1, 2023 with updates due every March 1 thereafter. Owners are also required to inform the Rent Board within 30 days of any change in the name or business contact information of the owner or designated property manager. The Rent Board uses this information to create and maintain a “housing inventory” of all units in San Francisco that are subject to the Rent Ordinance. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe Rent Board has developed a secure website  portal that provides an interface for owners to submit the required information (The Housing Inventory). The Rent Board uses the information provided to generate reports and surveys, to investigate and analyze rents and vacancies, to monitor compliance with the Rent Ordinance, and to assist landlords and tenants and other City departments as needed. The Rent Board may not use the information to operate a “rental registry” within the meaning of California Civil Code Sections 1947.7 – 1947.8.C. UPDATE PROCESSThe Housing Inventory is continuously updated as it receives submissions from the public. The portal is available to the public 24/7. The Rent Board Staff also makes regular updates to the data during regular business hours, and the data is shared to DataSF every 24 hours.  D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETIt is important to note that this dataset contains information submitted by residential property owners and tenants. The Rent Board does not review or verify the accuracy of the data submitted. Please note that historical data is subject to change. Notes for Analysis- Addresses have been anonymized to the block level- Latitude & Longitude are the closest mid-block point to the unit- Each row is a unit. To count total units, first select a year then count unique ids. Do not sum unit count.",

Information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, ethnicity, and sex are recorded in CAIR2 and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. Because CAIR2 does not include information on sexual orientation, we pull information from the San Francisco Department of Public Health’s  Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR). The populations represented in our Epic data and the CAIR2 data are different. Epic data only include vaccinations administered at SFDPH managed sites to SF residents.  Data notes for population characteristic types are listed below. Age * Data only include individuals who are 18 years of age or older.  Race/ethnicity * The response option \"Other Race\" is categorized by the data source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data.  Sex * The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. Sexual orientation * The response option “Unknown/Declined” refers to a lack of data or individuals who reported multiple different sexual orientations during their most recent interaction with SFDPH.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-reportB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.C. UPDATE PROCESSThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.E. DATA NOTES Reporting UpdateSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.Change in Status DefinitionsThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)   (1) Construction:  projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:o\tan issued full building permit, ORo\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction documentPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage. (2) Building Permit Issued:  includes projects that have an issued site permit but don’t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.Past definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.A data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: https://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx",

See “How to use this dataset” below for more details on how the data has been aggregated. Sales tax is collected by businesses on many types of transactions and regulated by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDData is collected by HDL. The data is then aggregated based on the criteria outlined in the \"How to use this dataset\" section. C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset will be updated annually. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis dataset can be used to analyze sales tax data over time across census blocks in San Francisco. Due to data privacy protection regulations for businesses, sales tax data is not available for all census blocks. Census blocks where there are less than 4 businesses paying sales tax or a single business that pays 80% or more of the total sales tax have been combined with neighboring Census Blocks to protect the confidentiality of affected businesses. Because of this aggregation, some Census Block groups in this dataset may change in future years as the number of businesses in a particular Census Block changes. The historical data changes based on audit findings and amended returns. If census block groupings change, it will happen when the dataset is updated - on an annual basis. These new blocks will be backfilled to previous years.Additionally, business payers with multiple locations (for example chain stores) are excluded because sales tax cannot be tied back to the location where it was collected.Finally, census blocks in the area field are from 2010 (GEOID10) and not from 2020.A map of this dataset can be viewed here.",

To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the Sheriff's Office at sheriff.tech.services@sfgov.org The dataset provides summary information on individuals booked into the San Francisco City and County Jail since 2012, categorized by ethnicity. The table provides a breakdown of the total number of bookings by month and ethnicity. The unit of measure is the jail booking number. The data is collected by the Sheriff's Office and includes self-report and assigned data. However, some ethnicity categories with small sample sizes are grouped together to reduce the risk of re-identification and protect the privacy of individuals booked into jail.The booking process refers to the procedure that occurs after an individual has been arrested and is taken into custody. The process begins with the arrest of an individual by law enforcement officers. The arrest can take place on the scene or at a later time if a warrant is issued. Once the individual has been arrested, and statutory law requires incarceration, they would be transported to the jail for booking. The arresting officer will record the reason for the arrest, along with any other relevant information. The sheriff’s deputies will then book the individual into jail, which involves taking their fingerprints, photograph, and recording personal information. The jail will assign a booking number, which is used to identify the individual throughout their time in custody. Once the booking process is complete, the individual will be incarcerated and will remain in custody until they are released per court order.Disclaimer: The San Francisco Sheriff's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDWhen an arrest is presented to the Sheriff’s Office, relevant data is manually entered into the Sheriff Office's jail management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, and added to Open Data.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is scheduled to update monthly.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data can be used to identify trends and patterns in the jail population over time. The date in this dataset is based on the date the suspect was booked into county jail for the arresting incident. The unit of measurement for this dataset is the booking number.

SUMMARYThis dataset contains data from financial statements of campaign committees that file with the San Francisco Ethics Commission and (1) contribute to or (2) receive funds from a San Francisco committee which was Primarily Formed for a local election, or (3) filed a Late Reporting Period statement with the SFEC. Financial statements are included for a committee if they meet any of the three criteria for each election included in the search parameters and are not primarily formed for the election. The search period for financial statements begins two years before an election and runs through the next semi-annual filing deadline. The dataset currently filters by the elections of 2024-03-05 and 2024-11-05.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDuring an election period an automated script runs nightly to examine filings by Primarily Formed San Francisco committees. If a primarily formed committee reports accepting money from or giving money to a second committee, that second committee's ID number is added to a filter list. If a committee electronically files a late reporting period form with the San Francisco Ethics Commission, the committee's ID number is also included in the filter list. The filter list is used in a second step that looks for filings by committees that file with the San Francisco Ethics Commission or the California Secretary of State. This dataset shows the output of the second step for committees that file with the San Francisco Ethics Commission. The data comes from a nightly search of the Ethics Commission campaign database. A second dataset includes committees that file with the Secretary of State.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is rewritten nightly and is based on data derived from campaign filings. The update script runs automatically on a timer during the 90 days before an election. Refer to the \"Data Last Updated\" date in the section \"About This Dataset\" on the landing page to see when the script last ran successfully.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETTransactions from all FPPC Form 460 schedules are presented together, refer to the Form Type to differentiate.Transactions from FPPC Form 461 and Form 465 filings are presented together, refer to the Form Type to differentiate.Transactions with a Form Type of D, E, F, G, H, F461P5, F465P3, F496, or F497P2 represent expenditures, or money spent by the committee. Transactions with Form Type A, B1, C, I, F496P3, and F497P1 represent receipts, or money taken in by the committee. Refer to the instructions for Forms 460, 496, and 497 for more details.Transactions on Form 460 Schedules D, F, G, and H are also reported on Schedule E.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYSan Francisco International Airport (SFO) keeps track of historical flight operations, also known as aircraft RADAR data for analysis and reporting.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDetails of flights from the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Offload Program are processed into SFO’s Airport Noise and Operations Management System (ANOMS) where it is correlated with noise reports from the communities and to noise levels collected from noise monitor sites on the San Francisco Peninsula. In ANOMS, various analysis gates (imaginary vertical curtain in space) are used to identify which route flights flew departing and arriving SFO. It serves to quantify, analyze, respond to noise concerns, and report on Runway Use and various programs to reduce aircraft noise in communities surrounding SFO.C. UPDATE PROCESSData is available starting in August 2019 and will be updated monthly.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETIt is important to note, that this dataset is of flights departing and landing at SFO only and not flight activities associated with other airports in the Bay Area region. This information is the data source used to produce the Flight Operations sections (pages 3-5) of the Airport Director’s Report. These reports are presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-reportE. RELATED DATASETSUnique Flight Operations - This filtered view contains unique records of flight operations. For example, one record for a flight that departed SFO or one record for a flight that landed at SFO.Arrival and Departure Routes - This filtered view contains records of flights with details of analysis gate(s) the aircraft flight track penetrates, to derive which route was used to depart and land at SFO.This dataset contains Operations and Arrival and Departure Routes joined on operation_number.  The field gate_penetration is derived by ordering the arrival and departure routes for each operation over gate_penetration_time. Unique_identifier is then created by joining operation_number and gate_penetration.Other provided datasets are Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Air Carrier Runway Use, and Late Night Preferential Runway Use, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Noise Exceedance Rating.Please contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.Date created: November 17, 2023",

    "description": "A.\tSUMMARYThis information shows SFO’s Nighttime Preferential Runway Use program and air carrier operations using jet and regional aircraft. The Nighttime Preferential Runway Use program aims to maximize overwater departures and minimize flights over residential areas between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. to reduce aircraft noise in surrounding communities. The preferred departing runways during these hours are Runways 10 Left (10L) / 10 Right (10R), 1 Left (1L) / 1 Right (1R), or 28 Left (28L) / 28 Right (28R) with an immediate right-turn; when safety, weather, and traffic operations permit. Although the program cannot be used 100% of the time due to these factors, all stakeholders work together to maximize its use when conditions allow. This dataset also provides air carrier total monthly departures and monthly arrivals by runway, along with percent utilization. B.\tHOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDetails of flights from the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Offload Program are processed into SFO’s Airport Noise and Operations Management System (ANOMS) where reports are generated.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis dataset contains data from financial statements of state committees that (1) contribute to or (2) receive funds from a San Francisco committee which was Primarily Formed for a local election, or (3) filed a Late Reporting Period statement with the SFEC during the 90 days before an election. The search period for financial statements begins two years before an election and runs through the next semi-annual filing deadline. The dataset currently filters by the elections of 2024-03-05 and 2024-11-05.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDuring an election period, an automated script runs nightly to examine filings by Primarily Formed San Francisco committees. If a primarily formed committee reports accepting money from or giving money to a second committee, that second committee's ID number is added to a filter list. If a committee electronically files a late reporting period form with the San Francisco Ethics Commission, the committee's ID number is also included in the filter list. The filter list is used in a second step that looks for filings by committees that file with the San Francisco Ethics Commission or the California Secretary of State. This dataset shows the committees that file with the California Secretary of State. The data comes from a nightly export of the Secretary of State's database. A second dataset includes Non-Primarily Formed committees that file with the San Francisco Ethics Commission.C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is rewritten nightly based on data derived from campaign filings. The update script runs automatically on a timer during the 90 days before an election. Refer to the \"Data Last Updated\" date in the section \"About This Dataset\" on the landing page to see when the script last ran successfully.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETTransactions from all FPPC Form 460 schedules are presented together, refer to the Form Type to differentiate.Transactions with a Form Type of D, E, F, G, H, F496, or F497P2 represent expenditures or money spent by the committee. Transactions with Form Type A, B1, C, I, F496P3, and F497P1 represent receipts or money taken in by the committee. Refer to the instructions for Forms 460, 496, and 497 for more details.Transactions on Form 460 Schedules D, F, G, and H are also reported on Schedule E. When doing summary statistics use care not to double count expenditures.Transactions from FPPC Form 496 and Form 497 filings are also in this dataset. Transactions that were reported on these forms are also reported on the Form 460 at the next filing deadline.

SUMMARYThis dataset consists of late-night flights departing between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. It serves to quantify, measure, and report on how well airlines use over-water routing established by the Federal Aviation Administration and reduce aircraft overflying the San Francisco Peninsula to help mitigate noise.This information is the data source used to produce a one-page report, “NIITE to GOBBS 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.” on page 5 of the monthly Airport Director’s Report. This report is available online at https://www.flysfo.com/about/community-noise/noise-office/reports/airport-directors-reportB. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETIt is important to note that not all flight records will have measurement details associated with the two navigation waypoints used in this analysis because not all flights will use them. However, there will be flights that flew by both navigation waypoints, so those respective measurement details are provided.C. UPDATE PROCESSData is available starting in September 2022 and will be updated on a monthly basis.Please contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.Date created: May 30, 2023",

It is a very, very unlikely scenario that would only occur if no efforts to address SLR occur and both a King Tide and 100-year storm occur at the same time. The real purpose of the maps is to provide a broad net to help the City identify projects that that may be vulnerable. The data is based on what was in the ground as of 2010 and doesn’t include piers. The inundation maps and the associated analyses are intended as planning level tools to illustrate the potential for inundation and coastal flooding under a variety of future sea level rise and storm surge scenarios. The maps depict possible future inundation that could occur if nothing is done to adapt or prepare for sea level rise over the next century. The maps do not represent the exact location or depth of flooding. The maps relied on a 1-m digital elevation model created from LiDAR data collected in 2010 and 2011. Although care was taken to capture all relevant topographic features and coastal structures that may impact coastal inundation, it is possible that structures narrower than the 1-m horizontal map scale may not be fully represented. The maps are based on model outputs and do not account for all of the complex and dynamic San Francisco Bay processes or future conditions such as erosion, subsidence, future construction or shoreline protection upgrades, or other changes to San Francisco Bay or the region that may occur in response to sea level rise. For more context about the maps and analyses, including a description of the data and methods used, please see the Climate Stressors and Impacts Report: Bayside Sea Level Rise Inundation Mapping Technical Memorandum, July 2014.More information at http://onesanfrancisco.org/node/148",

This study has been conducted periodically by CC&G since 2013.Primary goals of this study include:• Estimate mode share for trips into, within, and out of San Francisco, focusing on the percentage of trips made by walking, biking, and public transit compared to other modes (e.g. driving, TNC, etc.). This survey is the primary instrument for tracking the SFMTA Strategic Plan metric “transportation mode share” and provides information used by the agency across divisions.• Evaluation of the above statement based on the number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Note that trips by visitors from outside the Bay Area, and for commercial purposes whether originating in the Bay Area or not, are not included.• Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.• Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.The survey was conducted as a telephone study among 756 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Telephone surveying was conducted during May – September 2021. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.To enhance statistical accuracy, data was weighted by age and location. Not all totals will add to 100% due to rounding. In portions of this report, a dash (-) is used to indicate no respondents answered with the response code listed. The margin of error at the 95% confidence level is +/-3.56% for the total sample (n = 756). For other sample sizes, the margin of error is as follows:• San Francisco residents; n = 470. Margin of error = +/- 4.52%• Bay Area residents (outside San Francisco) n = 286. Margin of error = +/- 5.79%",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThe Municipal Natural Gas Equipment Inventory serves to catalog natural gas-fueled equipment used in municipally owned buildings. This inventory, implemented by the SF Environment Department, aims to establish an understanding of the scope of work needed to electrify municipal buildings and inform an effective and collaborative planning process.This effort was identified as an action in Section BO-2.4 of the  2021 Climate Action Plan and is included in the Environment Code Chapter 7 (Municipal Green Building Requirements). B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe list of buildings required to report data for the Municipal Natural Gas Equipment Inventory was compiled by cross-referencing the City’s  Facility Systems of Record and the  2020 municipal benchmarking report to identify all city-owned buildings with non-zero carbon emissions. Numerous municipal buildings are exempt from these reporting requirements, including facilities of the Port of San Francisco and buildings with a primary purpose of providing collection, storage, treatment, delivery, distribution, and/or transmission of water, wastewater, and/or power utilities. Each department received an inventory template, provided by the Environment Department, to submit high level building data and detailed information on each piece of natural gas equipment in use in these buildings. Departments were asked to self-report the required building and equipment data over the course of a 6-month data collection period in 2023 and are asked to keep this inventory up to date in the following years as equipment is replaced. C. UPDATE PROCESSThe inventory will be regularly updated by department representatives via the inventory PowerApp. When a gas-powered equipment item is retired or replaced, departments are asked to mark it as no longer in use and provide information on any electric replacement equipment, if applicable. While departments have the flexibility to update the inventory at any time, they are encouraged to do so at 6 month intervals at the minimum. Updated inventory data will be automatically reflected in this dataset. D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETIt is important to note that this dataset does not include facilities of the Port of San Francisco and buildings with a primary purpose of providing collection, storage, treatment, delivery, distribution, and/or transmission of water, wastewater, and/or power utilities, in accordance with Environment Code Chapter 7 exemptions.",

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis table contains all fatalities resulting from a traffic crash in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD’s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.The fatality table contains information about each party injured or killed in the collision, including any passengers. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. This table is filtered for fatal traffic crashes. C. UPDATE PROCESSAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4).D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge the Vision Zero initiative and the TransBASE database as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analysis, interpretation, or communication.TransBASE is a geospatially enabled database maintained by SFDPH that currently includes over 200 spatially referenced variables from multiple agencies and across a range of geographic scales, including infrastructure, transportation, zoning, sociodemographic, and collision data, all linked to an intersection or street segment. TransBASE facilitates a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing transportation-related health issues, informed by a large and growing evidence base regarding the importance of transportation system design and land use decisions for health. TransBASE’s purpose is to inform public and private efforts to improve transportation system safety, sustainability, community health and equity in San Francisco.E.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.",

Data updates as more information becomes available. Because of this, death totals may increase or decrease.  Population characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Death certificates are maintained by the California Department of Public Health.Data on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: *Case reports *Medical records *Electronic lab reports *Death certificates Data are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths. To protect resident privacy, we summarize COVID-19 data by only one population characteristic at a time. Data are not shown until cumulative citywide deaths reach five or more.  Data notes on select population characteristic types are listed below. Race/ethnicity * We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.Gender* The City collects information on gender identity using these guidelines.C. UPDATE PROCESSUpdates automatically at 06:30 and 07:30 AM Pacific Time on Wednesday each week.Dataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a dataset based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset.These population estimates are from the 2018-2022 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).This dataset includes several characteristic types. Filter the “Characteristic Type” column to explore a topic area. Then, the “Characteristic Group” column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of cumulative deaths. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths in that characteristic group up to the date listed.To explore data on the total number of deaths, use the COVID-19 Deaths Over Time dataset.E.

Vision Zero is the collaborative, citywide effort to end traffic fatalities in San Francisco. The goal of this benchmarking effort is to provide context to San Francisco’s work and progress on key Vision Zero metrics alongside its peers. The Controller's Office City Performance team collaborated with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the San Francisco Police Department, and other stakeholders on this project. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe Vision Zero Benchmarking website has seven major metrics. The City Performance team collected the data for each metric separately, cleaned it, and visualized it on the website. This dataset has all seven metrics and some additional underlying data. The majority of the data is available through public sources, but a few data points came from the peer cities themselves. C. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset is for historical purposes only and will not be updated. To explore more recent data, visit the source website for the relevant metrics.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThis dataset contains all of the Vision Zero Benchmarking metrics. Filter for the metric of interest, then explore the data. Where applicable, datasets already include a total. For example, under the Fatalities metric, the \"Total Fatalities\" category within the metric shows the total fatalities in that city.

    "description": "A. SUMMARYThis data was created by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) to update the 2017 Vision Zero High Injury Network dataset. It identifies street segments in San Francisco that have a high number of fatalities and severe injuries. This dataset is a simplified representation of the network and only indicates which streets qualified; it does not contain any additional information, including prioritization by mode or a breakdown of count reported/unreported severe/fatal injuries by corridorized segment. SFDPH shares this network with CCSF agencies to help inform where interventions could save lives and reduce injury severity.B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDThe 2022 Vision Zero High Injury Network is derived from 2017-2022 severe and fatal injury data from Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), the Office of the Medical Examiner (OME), and Emergency Medical Services agencies. ZSFG patient records and SFPD victim records were probabilistically linked through the Transportation Injury Surveillance System (TISS) using LinkSolv Software. Injury severity for linked SFPD/ZSFG records was reclassified based on injury outcome as determined by ZSFG medical personnel (net 1732 police reported severe injuries) consistent with the Vision Zero Severe Injury Protocol (2017) while unlinked SFPD victim records were not changed (178 police reported severe injuries). Severe injuries captured by ZSFG but not reported to SFPD were also included in this analysis (650 unreported/unlinked geocodable severe injury patient records). Fatality data came from OME records that meet San Francisco’s Vision Zero Fatality Protocol (129 fatalities).Only transportation-related injuries resulting in a severe injury or fatality were used in this analysis. Each street centerline segment block was converted into ~0.25 mile overlapping corridorized sections using ArcPy. These sections were intersected with the severe/fatal injury data. Only severe/fatal injuries with the same primary street as the corridorized section were counted for that section. The count of severe/fatal injuries was then normalized by the sections mileage to derive the number of severe/fatal injuries per mile. A threshold of ≥10 severe/fatal injuries per mile was used as the threshold to determine if a corridorized segment qualified for inclusion into the network. A full methodology of the 2022 update to the Vision Zero High Injury Network can be found here: https://www.visionzerosf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022_Vision_Zero_Network_Update_Methodology.pdfC. UPDATE PROCESSThis dataset will be updated on an as needed basis.D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASETThe 2022 Vision Zero Network represents a snapshot in time (2017-2021) where severe and fatal injuries are most concentrated. It may not reflect current conditions or changes to the City’s transportation system. Although prior incidents can be indicative of future incidents, the 2022 Vision Zero High Injury Network is not a prediction (probability) of future risk. The High Injury Network approach is in contrast to risk-based analysis, which focuses on locations determined to be more dangerous with increased risk or danger often calculated by dividing the number of injuries or collisions by vehicle volumes to estimate risk of injury per vehicle. The High Injury Network provides information regarding the streets where injuries, particularly severe and fatal, are concentrated in San Francisco based on injury counts; it is not an assessment of whether a street or particular location is dangerous. The 2022 Vision Zero Network is derived from the more severe injury outcomes (count of severe/fatal injuries) and may not cover locations with high numbers of less severe injury collisions.Hospital and emergency medical service records from which SFPD-unreported injury and reclassified injury collisions are derived are protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and state medical privacy laws, thus have strict confidentiality and privacy requirements. As of November 2021, SFDPH is working in conjunction with SFDPH’s Office of Compliance and Privacy Affairs, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (“ZSFG”) and the SFMTA to determine how SFDPH can share the data in compliance with federal and state privacy laws. Intersection and other small-area specific counts of severe/fatal injuries have thus been intentionally excluded from this document as data sharing requirements are yet to be determined.E.

SUMMARYThis dataset shows all projects that satisfied their Inclusionary Housing requirements through one of the options other than on-site affordable units, although some of these projects met requirements through a combination of options that included on-site units. B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATEDDevelopments of 10 or more units that are subject to Planning Code Section 415 fall under the City's Inclusionary Affordable Housing program. Section 415 requires that developers include affordable units on-site or alternatively pay a fee or dedicate land to MOHCD, or build affordable units at another location (off-site).C.
